TeamProjectMigLayout: Ali Aris(Admin), James McDonnell, Micheal Burke
====================

Ali: Main java functionality and GUI setup.
James: Inital GUI setup and project functionality.
Micheal: Action button functionality and GUI setup.
All: General changes to miglayout GUI and functionality.

At the start of the project all three of us were administrators and could not
function properly. We realized this and changed this soon after.
Micheal did not have access when we did this so he could not contribute for a while.
When we reset the project making Ali admin and this was fine.
