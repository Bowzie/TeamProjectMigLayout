TeamProjectMigLayout: Ali Aris(Admin), James McDonnell, Micheal Burke
https://github.com/Bowzie/TeamProjectMigLayout/
====================

Ali (Bowzie) : Main java functionality and GUI setup.

James (Agroman) : Inital GUI setup and project functionality.

Micheal (Forza-Milan) : Action button functionality and GUI setup.

All: General changes to miglayout GUI and functionality.

At the start of the project all three of us were administrators and could not
function properly. We were all collaborators at the start due to some problems we had with updating forks. 
We realized this was a bad move and changed this soon after, leaving Ali as the sole admin for the project.
Micheal did not have access when we did this so he could not contribute for a while. Some early commits are shown as from an unkown account due to the 3 of us being collaborators as well.

To setup this project locally, clone the repo to a desired location using the git clone command. The project should just work when imported into eclipse, any external jars used are in the project folder and are referenced properly in the .classpath files.

The functionality of this project is a multiple translator. Text (English) is inputted into a text area and when the
translate button is pressed, the text is translated through any of the selected radio buttons which correspond to a different
language. The text is then translated back into English and displayed in a second text area, which sometimes peculiar
results. 

The goal of this project is to demonstrate/develop MiG Layout and Git skills learnt in class.
